r"""Macro adapter for this document. Loaded and executed by the agent's flattener.

The contract, in short: pure text -> text, called once at the start of macro expansion,
deterministic, and it *reports* unresolved keys rather than dropping them. Determinism
matters because a wiki publisher hashes rendered content to decide what to rewrite; a
function that expands the same input two ways produces spurious edits on every sync.

You only need an entry here for macros **this document defines**. Package conventions the
engine already understands — \acrshort, \gls, \cref, \ExecuteMetaData, biblatex commands —
are handled upstream and must not be re-implemented.

A macro that is defined in document_settings.sty but missing here does not fail loudly: it
survives into the corpus as raw LaTeX and the agent quotes it at a reader verbatim. That is
the failure this file exists to prevent, which is why unresolved keys are collected and
returned rather than silently passed through.
